# Session Transfer Log — Project Intake Triage

Append-only record of implementation activity. Newest entry at the bottom.
One entry per phase / agent execution.

---
## Phase 0 — Setup: docs/ folder + session log
- **When:** 2026-06-18T22:46:27Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8
- **Done:** Created `docs/`, copied the finalized implementation plan to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (669 lines, verbatim from the approved plan), and initialized this append-only session transfer log.
- **Files touched:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (new), `docs/SESSION_TRANSFER_LOG.md` (new)
- **Commands run + result:** `mkdir -p docs && cp <plan> docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → 669 lines copied
- **Commit:** `f711783` docs(plan): add implementation plan and session transfer log
- **Verification:** `docs/` contains both files; plan copied verbatim; commit landed on main.
- **Notes / deviations:** none
- **Next:** Phase 1 — Data model

## Plan amendment — AI response parser as explicit testable unit
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:01:57Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (coordinating)
- **Done:** Verified work left by a parallel agent (don't-trust-but-verify): it had created `app/lib/ai/parse.test.ts` and rewritten `README.md`, but the test was NOT runnable (no `parse.ts`, no `vitest.config.ts`, no `test` script). Amended the plan to make AI parsing a standalone pure unit `lib/ai/parse.ts` → `parseAiResponse(raw)` (no network/DB, fence-tolerant, never throws), with `lib/ai-triage.ts` delegating to it so both AI failure modes (call fails / output unparseable) converge on `needs_review`. Aligned the LLM/schema field name on `risks` (DB column stays `aiRiskChecklist`). Relocated the pre-authored test to `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` per the chosen root-`lib/` structure (user decision); removed `app/lib/`.
- **Files touched:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (amended Phases 2/3/4/7/8 + decisions + manifest), `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (relocated, uncommitted), `app/lib/` (removed). README rewrite left uncommitted in working tree (owned by Phase 8).
- **Commands run + result:** `rm -rf app/lib`; `cp <master plan> docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → 725 lines.
- **Commit:** (this amendment) docs(plan): make AI response parsing an explicit testable unit
- **Verification:** plan internally consistent (`risks` field, `ok`→`completed` mapping, column `aiRiskChecklist`); parser test relocated to root-`lib/`; `app/lib/` gone.
- **Notes / deviations:** README (`README.md`) and the parser test (`lib/ai/parse.test.ts`) remain uncommitted in the working tree by design — they are Phase 8 / Phase 7 deliverables and will be committed in those phases. Per-phase commits use explicit `git add` paths so these won't leak into earlier commits.
- **Next:** Phase 1 — Data model

---
## Reconciliation — concurrent parallel-session commits absorbed
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:06:02Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (coordinating)
- **Done:** ⚠️ Discovered a **second session committing to `main` concurrently** during this turn. It landed two commits on top of my Phase 0 (`f711783`) that were NOT present when the turn began: `f332d36` (README rewrite — so README is committed, not just a working-tree edit as the prior log entry assumed) and `c3a1f80` (parser test at `app/lib/ai/`, `vitest.config.ts` scoped to `app/**`, and `package.json` `"test"` script). My plan-amendment commit (`17af95d`) happened to serialize cleanly on top of `c3a1f80` (no path overlap). Reconciled in `b29f641`: git-renamed the parser test `app/lib/ai/parse.test.ts` → `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (matches the agreed root-`lib/` structure), widened the vitest `include` glob to `["lib/**/*.test.ts","app/**/*.test.ts"]`, and added the `@/` alias. Corrected the plan's Phase 7/8 notes to reflect that the README + vitest wiring + parser test are already committed.
- **Files touched:** `vitest.config.ts` (include + alias), `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (renamed from `app/lib/ai/`), `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 7/8 corrections).
- **Commands run + result:** `git status`/`git show --stat` to map the graph; `git add` rename + config; commit `b29f641`. Working tree clean after.
- **Commit:** `b29f641` refactor(test): relocate AI parser test to lib/ and align vitest config
- **Verification:** `git status` clean; branch linear `bb906a9 → f711783 → f332d36 → c3a1f80 → 17af95d → b29f641`; rename detected by git (`R`).
- **Notes / deviations:** **COORDINATION HAZARD — paused for user decision.** Two agents committing to one branch concurrently nearly caused a non-fast-forward/divergence; it only serialized cleanly by luck (non-overlapping paths). Recommend the other session stop committing to `main` so this session can drive the phases sequentially (per the agreed stop-after-each-phase model), or we agree on an explicit division. Have NOT started Phase 1.
- **Next:** Await user decision on coordination; then Phase 1 — Data model

---
## Phase 1 — Data model
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:09:32Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver — user parked the other session)
- **Done:** Added the `Intake` model to `prisma/schema.prisma` (autoincrement `Int` id; 5 intake string fields; `createdAt`; AI columns `aiStatus`/`aiSummary`/`aiTags`/`aiRiskChecklist`/`aiError`, with tags+risks stored as JSON strings). Ran `prisma generate` + `migrate dev --name init_intake`. Added `lib/prisma.ts` — hot-reload-safe singleton wiring the required Prisma 7 driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`).
- **Files touched:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `lib/prisma.ts` (new), `prisma/migrations/20260618230813_init_intake/` (new), `package.json` + `package-lock.json` (deps), `.gitignore` (ignore `*.db`).
- **Commands run + result:** `npm i @prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3@7.8.0 better-sqlite3@12.11.1` → ok; `npm i -D dotenv prisma@7.8.0` (both required to load `prisma.config.ts`) → ok; `npx prisma generate` → client to `app/generated/prisma`; `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_intake` → `dev.db` created, migration applied; `npx tsc --noEmit` → only error is `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` importing `./parse` (expected — Phase 3 file), Phase 1 code clean.
- **Commit:** `a3ef6c2` feat(db): add Intake model with Prisma driver-adapter singleton
- **Verification:** generate + migrate succeeded; migration + lock committed; `dev.db` gitignored (local state); singleton type-checks. NOTE: the adapter singleton isn't runtime-exercised yet (migrate uses the engine, not the adapter) — first real runtime use is Phase 4/7.
- **Notes / deviations:** Two unplanned-but-required dep installs: `dotenv` and `prisma` (the scaffold's `prisma.config.ts` imports both; generate/migrate failed until installed). Generated client has NO package-root index → singleton imports from `@/app/generated/prisma/client` (the plan's "if this differs" fallback). `dev.db` lives at app-root (not `prisma/`) because `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db` resolves to cwd.
- **Next:** Phase 2 — Type contracts (lib/schemas.ts)

---
## Phase 2 — Type contracts
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:14:09Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Created `lib/schemas.ts` (root `lib/`) verbatim from the plan: `intakeCreateSchema` (5 trimmed string fields — title/description/budgetRange/timeline/industry — each `.min(1, { error })` with field-specific required messages + `.max()` caps) and `aiTriageOutputSchema` (`summary` non-empty, `tags` exactly length 3, `risks` `.min(1)`). Exported inferred types `IntakeCreateInput` and `AiTriageOutput` via `z.infer`. Field is `risks` (DB column `aiRiskChecklist` mapped later in Phase 4).
- **Files touched:** `lib/schemas.ts` (new).
- **Commands run + result:** verified Zod 4.4.3 installed; `find-docs` (ctx7 `/websites/zod_dev_v4`) confirmed Zod 4 unified `error` param (`message` deprecated) and `z.array().min(1)`/`.length()` + `z.infer` syntax — plan code matches; `npx tsc --noEmit` → only pre-existing `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` `./parse` error (expected, Phase 3), `lib/schemas.ts` clean.
- **Commit:** `01d8b2a` feat(schemas): add Zod contracts for intake input and AI output
- **Verification:** type-check clean for the new file; only the known Phase-3 RED test import remains; committed with explicit path (no leakage).
- **Notes / deviations:** none. Verified Zod 4 syntax against current docs before writing (don't-trust-but-verify) rather than coding from memory.
- **Next:** Phase 3 — AI triage (parser unit `lib/ai/parse.ts` + network caller `lib/ai-triage.ts`)

---
## Phase 3 — AI triage (parser unit + network call)
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:17:44Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Created `lib/ai/parse.ts` (`parseAiResponse`) — pure, no network/DB, never throws: strips ```` ```json ```` fences, `JSON.parse`s, validates against `aiTriageOutputSchema`; any failure → `status: "needs_review"` with `raw` retained. Created `lib/ai-triage.ts` (`runAiTriage`) — DeepSeek call via the `openai` SDK (baseURL `https://api.deepseek.com`, 20s timeout, `response_format: { type: "json_object" }`, model `deepseek-chat`), delegates parsing to `parseAiResponse`; both failure modes (call fails / output unparseable) converge on `{ status: "needs_review" }`, success returns `{ status: "completed", summary, tags, risks }`. Both files verbatim from the plan.
- **Files touched:** `lib/ai/parse.ts` (new), `lib/ai-triage.ts` (new), `package.json` + `package-lock.json` (openai dep).
- **Commands run + result:** `.env` confirmed to contain `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; `npm install openai@6.44.0` → installed (v6.44.0 confirmed); `find-docs` (ctx7 `/websites/developers_openai_api`) confirmed the `new OpenAI({...})` constructor-options + `chat.completions.create` pattern still current for the Node SDK; `npx tsc --noEmit` → CLEAN (parser now resolves the test import — the prior known RED error is gone); `npx vitest run lib/ai/parse.test.ts` → 6/6 PASS. No real API call made (parser tested with hardcoded strings; live call deferred to Phase 8).
- **Commit:** `3700ddb` feat(ai): add AI response parser unit and DeepSeek triage caller
- **Verification:** full type-check clean; pre-authored parser contract green (well-formed, fenced, prose, missing-field, truncated, empty all covered); committed with explicit paths.
- **Notes / deviations:** ⚠️ Observed `docs/HANDOFF.md` showing as DELETED in the working tree (`D` in `git status`) — NOT done by this phase and NOT included in the Phase 3 commit (staged explicit paths only). Left untouched/unstaged for the user to decide. The DeepSeek model name (`deepseek-chat`) remains the plan default per the open TBD; not validated against the live API yet (Phase 8).
- **Next:** Phase 4 — API routes (`app/api/intakes/route.ts` POST/GET + `[id]` GET)

---
## Live validation — DeepSeek key + model (between Phase 3 and 4, user-requested)
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:24:00Z (approx)
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** At the user's request, validated `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` with a throwaway script exercising the exact app path (openai SDK → `https://api.deepseek.com`, `response_format: json_object`, model `deepseek-chat`, same prompt shape as `lib/ai-triage.ts`). Call SUCCEEDED: key authenticates; returned clean JSON with `summary` + exactly 3 `tags` + 3 `risks` (satisfies `aiTriageOutputSchema` → would parse `status: "ok"`); 187 total tokens.
- **Files touched:** `scripts/validate-deepseek.mjs` (created then DELETED — throwaway, not committed).
- **Commands run + result:** `node scripts/validate-deepseek.mjs` → ✅ success.
- **Commit:** none (validation only).
- **Verification:** end-to-end AI path confirmed working before route wiring.
- **Notes / deviations:** ⚠️ **Model-name TBD RESOLVED:** requested `"deepseek-chat"` but the response reported `model: deepseek-v4-flash` — so `deepseek-chat` is a valid alias resolving to `deepseek-v4-flash`. The plan's `deepseek-chat` works as-is; no code change needed.
- **Next:** Phase 4 — API routes

---
## Phase 4 — API routes
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:24:00Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Created `app/api/intakes/route.ts` (GET lists newest-first; POST validates via `intakeCreateSchema.safeParse` → 400 on bad JSON / validation fail, persists raw intake with `aiStatus: "pending"` BEFORE the AI call, runs `runAiTriage`, then updates the same row → `completed` with `aiSummary`/`aiTags`/`aiRiskChecklist` (tags+risks `JSON.stringify`'d, `risks`→`aiRiskChecklist`) or `needs_review` with `aiError`; returns 201) and `app/api/intakes/[id]/route.ts` (GET-by-id, Next 16 async `params: Promise<...>`, non-integer guard, 404 on miss). Both verbatim from the plan.
- **Files touched:** `app/api/intakes/route.ts` (new), `app/api/intakes/[id]/route.ts` (new).
- **Commands run + result:** verified Next 16 route-handler `params` signature against `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/.../route.md` (confirms `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }` + `await params`); `npx tsc --noEmit` → CLEAN; `npm run build` → ✓ compiled, both routes registered dynamic (`ƒ /api/intakes`, `ƒ /api/intakes/[id]`).
- **Commit:** `301a670` feat(api): add POST/GET intake routes with AI triage round-trip
- **Verification:** type-check + production build both pass; committed with explicit paths.
- **Notes / deviations:** Prisma driver adapter still not exercised at RUNTIME (build does static analysis only; first true runtime DB hit is a live POST). Deferred to a runtime smoke test (offered to user) / Phase 8. `.next/` is gitignored — not staged.
- **Next:** Phase 5 — Frontend flow (Client Components: list, new-intake form, detail)

---
## Smoke test — Phase 4 API runtime verification (user-requested)
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:25:00Z (approx)
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Ran the dev server and exercised every route end-to-end before building UI. Results: `GET /api/intakes` → `200 []`; `POST` valid intake → `201`, persisted id:1 with `aiStatus: "completed"`, real DeepSeek summary + 3 tags + 3 risks, `aiError: null`; `GET /api/intakes/1` → `200` full record; `GET /api/intakes/999` → `404`; `GET /api/intakes/abc` (non-integer) → `404`; `POST` blank/missing fields → `400` Zod issues incl. "Title is required"; `POST` malformed JSON → `400` "Request body must be valid JSON".
- **Files touched:** none (left `dev.db` with one test row — gitignored local state).
- **Commands run + result:** `npm run dev` + `curl` matrix (7 cases) — all behaved as specified.
- **Commit:** none (verification only).
- **Verification:** ✅ Prisma `better-sqlite3` driver adapter CONFIRMED working at runtime (closes the gap flagged since Phase 1); persist-then-triage-then-update flow proven; both 400 paths and both 404 paths correct; `aiTags`/`aiRiskChecklist` store JSON strings (`risks`→`aiRiskChecklist` mapping correct).
- **Notes / deviations:** Hit a stale `next dev` lock (an orphaned PID 77939 made the first launch bail to port 3001 then exit); killed leftovers and relaunched cleanly on :3000. AI `needs_review` path not exercised live (key healthy) — covered by parser unit tests + `runAiTriage` try/catch.
- **Next:** Phase 5 — Frontend flow

---
## Phase 5 — Frontend flow
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:27:00Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Built the three Client-Component pages + shared chrome, verbatim from the plan. `app/layout.tsx`: metadata title→"Project Intake Triage" + real description, shared header nav (Intake Triage / New intake) inside `<body>` before children (font/className wiring untouched). `app/page.tsx` (list): loading / error+Retry / empty / populated states, each row links to detail and shows industry · date · aiStatus badge. `app/intakes/new/page.tsx` (form): controlled inputs, submit disabled until all filled, "Submitting…" state, surfaces API `error` text, redirects to `/intakes/{created.id}` on success. `app/intakes/[id]/page.tsx` (detail): Next 16 `use(params)`, parses `aiTags`/`aiRiskChecklist` JSON, renders summary/tags/risks when `completed`, else an amber pending/manual-review banner (with collapsible `aiError`) so a failed triage never blocks viewing the saved submission; 404 → friendly not-found.
- **Files touched:** `app/layout.tsx` (edit), `app/page.tsx` (replaced scaffold), `app/intakes/new/page.tsx` (new), `app/intakes/[id]/page.tsx` (new).
- **Commands run + result:** `npx tsc --noEmit` → CLEAN; `npm run dev` + curl render check — `/`, `/intakes/new`, `/intakes/1`, `/intakes/999` all `200`, no errors in dev log; rendered HTML confirmed to contain header ("Intake Triage", "New intake"), document title ("Project Intake Triage"), list loading state, and form fields (Description / Budget range / Timeline / Create intake).
- **Commit:** `e044f75` feat(ui): add intake list, create form, and detail pages
- **Verification:** type-check clean; all routes render server-side without errors; expected content present in HTML; committed with explicit paths.
- **Notes / deviations:** Pages are client components (`"use client"`) so initial HTML is the shell + loading state; data hydrates client-side via fetch — matches the plan's single consistent fetch pattern. Full interactive click-through (form submit → redirect) best confirmed in a real browser during the Loom; server-side render + the Phase 4 smoke test together already prove the data path.
- **Next:** Phase 6 — UX states hardening

---
## Phase 6 — UX states hardening
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:30:39Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Created `app/not-found.tsx` (generic bad-route 404). Confirmed the Phase-5 hardening already in place: detail-page amber banner for `needs_review` vs `pending`, `aiError` behind `<details>`, raw intake fields always render, `parseList` guard (malformed stored JSON → banner not crash); form `disabled={submitting || !allFilled}` + top-of-handler `if (submitting || !allFilled) return;` double-submit guard; list error-state Retry re-runs `load()`.
- **Files touched:** `app/not-found.tsx` (new).
- **Commands run + result:** `npx tsc --noEmit` → CLEAN. **AI-failure path proven live:** started dev with `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-broken-invalid-key` (shell env overrides `.env` in Next), POSTed an intake → `201`, row persisted as id:2 with `aiStatus: "needs_review"`, `aiSummary/aiTags/aiRiskChecklist` null, `aiError: "401 Authentication Fails…"`, no crash. `/totally-bad-route` → `404` + "Page not found" (not-found.tsx). `/intakes/abc` + `/intakes/999` already 404 (Phase 5). 
- **Commit:** `ea91654` fix(ux): add manual-review banner, double-submit guard, and 404 page
- **Verification:** ✅ SPEC reliability guarantee end-to-end confirmed — submission persists even when AI fails; UX states all present (loading/empty/error+retry/not-found/needs_review banner).
- **Notes / deviations:** Detail-page banner is client-rendered (data fetched client-side), so the banner copy is absent from the server HTML shell — it appears post-hydration, driven by the confirmed `needs_review` status. `dev.db` now holds a `completed` row (#1) and a `needs_review` row (#2) — convenient demo state for the Loom.
- **Next:** Phase 7 — Tests (schemas, triage mock, route mocks; parser test already green)
