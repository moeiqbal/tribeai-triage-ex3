# Session Transfer Log — Project Intake Triage

Append-only record of implementation activity. Newest entry at the bottom.
One entry per phase / agent execution.

---
## Phase 0 — Setup: docs/ folder + session log
- **When:** 2026-06-18T22:46:27Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8
- **Done:** Created `docs/`, copied the finalized implementation plan to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (669 lines, verbatim from the approved plan), and initialized this append-only session transfer log.
- **Files touched:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (new), `docs/SESSION_TRANSFER_LOG.md` (new)
- **Commands run + result:** `mkdir -p docs && cp <plan> docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → 669 lines copied
- **Commit:** `f711783` docs(plan): add implementation plan and session transfer log
- **Verification:** `docs/` contains both files; plan copied verbatim; commit landed on main.
- **Notes / deviations:** none
- **Next:** Phase 1 — Data model

## Plan amendment — AI response parser as explicit testable unit
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:01:57Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (coordinating)
- **Done:** Verified work left by a parallel agent (don't-trust-but-verify): it had created `app/lib/ai/parse.test.ts` and rewritten `README.md`, but the test was NOT runnable (no `parse.ts`, no `vitest.config.ts`, no `test` script). Amended the plan to make AI parsing a standalone pure unit `lib/ai/parse.ts` → `parseAiResponse(raw)` (no network/DB, fence-tolerant, never throws), with `lib/ai-triage.ts` delegating to it so both AI failure modes (call fails / output unparseable) converge on `needs_review`. Aligned the LLM/schema field name on `risks` (DB column stays `aiRiskChecklist`). Relocated the pre-authored test to `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` per the chosen root-`lib/` structure (user decision); removed `app/lib/`.
- **Files touched:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (amended Phases 2/3/4/7/8 + decisions + manifest), `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (relocated, uncommitted), `app/lib/` (removed). README rewrite left uncommitted in working tree (owned by Phase 8).
- **Commands run + result:** `rm -rf app/lib`; `cp <master plan> docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → 725 lines.
- **Commit:** (this amendment) docs(plan): make AI response parsing an explicit testable unit
- **Verification:** plan internally consistent (`risks` field, `ok`→`completed` mapping, column `aiRiskChecklist`); parser test relocated to root-`lib/`; `app/lib/` gone.
- **Notes / deviations:** README (`README.md`) and the parser test (`lib/ai/parse.test.ts`) remain uncommitted in the working tree by design — they are Phase 8 / Phase 7 deliverables and will be committed in those phases. Per-phase commits use explicit `git add` paths so these won't leak into earlier commits.
- **Next:** Phase 1 — Data model

## Reconciliation — concurrent parallel-session commits absorbed
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:06:02Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (coordinating)
- **Done:** ⚠️ Discovered a **second session committing to `main` concurrently** during this turn. It landed two commits on top of my Phase 0 (`f711783`) that were NOT present when the turn began: `f332d36` (README rewrite — so README is committed, not just a working-tree edit as the prior log entry assumed) and `c3a1f80` (parser test at `app/lib/ai/`, `vitest.config.ts` scoped to `app/**`, and `package.json` `"test"` script). My plan-amendment commit (`17af95d`) happened to serialize cleanly on top of `c3a1f80` (no path overlap). Reconciled in `b29f641`: git-renamed the parser test `app/lib/ai/parse.test.ts` → `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (matches the agreed root-`lib/` structure), widened the vitest `include` glob to `["lib/**/*.test.ts","app/**/*.test.ts"]`, and added the `@/` alias. Corrected the plan's Phase 7/8 notes to reflect that the README + vitest wiring + parser test are already committed.
- **Files touched:** `vitest.config.ts` (include + alias), `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` (renamed from `app/lib/ai/`), `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 7/8 corrections).
- **Commands run + result:** `git status`/`git show --stat` to map the graph; `git add` rename + config; commit `b29f641`. Working tree clean after.
- **Commit:** `b29f641` refactor(test): relocate AI parser test to lib/ and align vitest config
- **Verification:** `git status` clean; branch linear `bb906a9 → f711783 → f332d36 → c3a1f80 → 17af95d → b29f641`; rename detected by git (`R`).
- **Notes / deviations:** **COORDINATION HAZARD — paused for user decision.** Two agents committing to one branch concurrently nearly caused a non-fast-forward/divergence; it only serialized cleanly by luck (non-overlapping paths). Recommend the other session stop committing to `main` so this session can drive the phases sequentially (per the agreed stop-after-each-phase model), or we agree on an explicit division. Have NOT started Phase 1.
- **Next:** Await user decision on coordination; then Phase 1 — Data model

## Phase 1 — Data model
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:09:32Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver — user parked the other session)
- **Done:** Added the `Intake` model to `prisma/schema.prisma` (autoincrement `Int` id; 5 intake string fields; `createdAt`; AI columns `aiStatus`/`aiSummary`/`aiTags`/`aiRiskChecklist`/`aiError`, with tags+risks stored as JSON strings). Ran `prisma generate` + `migrate dev --name init_intake`. Added `lib/prisma.ts` — hot-reload-safe singleton wiring the required Prisma 7 driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`).
- **Files touched:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `lib/prisma.ts` (new), `prisma/migrations/20260618230813_init_intake/` (new), `package.json` + `package-lock.json` (deps), `.gitignore` (ignore `*.db`).
- **Commands run + result:** `npm i @prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3@7.8.0 better-sqlite3@12.11.1` → ok; `npm i -D dotenv prisma@7.8.0` (both required to load `prisma.config.ts`) → ok; `npx prisma generate` → client to `app/generated/prisma`; `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_intake` → `dev.db` created, migration applied; `npx tsc --noEmit` → only error is `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` importing `./parse` (expected — Phase 3 file), Phase 1 code clean.
- **Commit:** `a3ef6c2` feat(db): add Intake model with Prisma driver-adapter singleton
- **Verification:** generate + migrate succeeded; migration + lock committed; `dev.db` gitignored (local state); singleton type-checks. NOTE: the adapter singleton isn't runtime-exercised yet (migrate uses the engine, not the adapter) — first real runtime use is Phase 4/7.
- **Notes / deviations:** Two unplanned-but-required dep installs: `dotenv` and `prisma` (the scaffold's `prisma.config.ts` imports both; generate/migrate failed until installed). Generated client has NO package-root index → singleton imports from `@/app/generated/prisma/client` (the plan's "if this differs" fallback). `dev.db` lives at app-root (not `prisma/`) because `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db` resolves to cwd.
- **Next:** Phase 2 — Type contracts (lib/schemas.ts)

---
## Phase 2 — Type contracts
- **When:** 2026-06-18T23:14:09Z
- **Agent/model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (sole driver)
- **Done:** Created `lib/schemas.ts` (root `lib/`) verbatim from the plan: `intakeCreateSchema` (5 trimmed string fields — title/description/budgetRange/timeline/industry — each `.min(1, { error })` with field-specific required messages + `.max()` caps) and `aiTriageOutputSchema` (`summary` non-empty, `tags` exactly length 3, `risks` `.min(1)`). Exported inferred types `IntakeCreateInput` and `AiTriageOutput` via `z.infer`. Field is `risks` (DB column `aiRiskChecklist` mapped later in Phase 4).
- **Files touched:** `lib/schemas.ts` (new).
- **Commands run + result:** verified Zod 4.4.3 installed; `find-docs` (ctx7 `/websites/zod_dev_v4`) confirmed Zod 4 unified `error` param (`message` deprecated) and `z.array().min(1)`/`.length()` + `z.infer` syntax — plan code matches; `npx tsc --noEmit` → only pre-existing `lib/ai/parse.test.ts` `./parse` error (expected, Phase 3), `lib/schemas.ts` clean.
- **Commit:** `01d8b2a` feat(schemas): add Zod contracts for intake input and AI output
- **Verification:** type-check clean for the new file; only the known Phase-3 RED test import remains; committed with explicit path (no leakage).
- **Notes / deviations:** none. Verified Zod 4 syntax against current docs before writing (don't-trust-but-verify) rather than coding from memory.
- **Next:** Phase 3 — AI triage (parser unit `lib/ai/parse.ts` + network caller `lib/ai-triage.ts`)
